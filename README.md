The Recipes and Shopping List app, developed with Angular and Firebase, allows users to create, view, and manage recipes as well as generate personalized shopping lists and modify them.
For the development of this application, I used Firebase Realtime Database, a NoSQL database service that stores and synchronizes data in real-time, and Firebase Authentication, which provides simple and secure authentication solutions using email, Google, Facebook, and other methods. As for the Angular framework, I implemented the web application utilizing specific features such as Two-Way Data Binding, Component-Based Architecture, Dependency Injection, Directives, Routing, Forms, Authentication, and more.

### Features:
User-friendly input handling with dynamic forms for seamless interaction.
HTTP Requests integration to communicate with the Firebase database and manage responses efficiently.
Authentication and route protection to secure user data.
Smooth navigation with Angular Routers for easy access across app pages.
